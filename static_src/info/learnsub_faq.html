	<h3 class="heading_3">What is the relationship between EZID, CDL, and DataCite? And do we have to join DataCite to get DOIs?</h3>
	<p>By working with CDL and EZID, you are automatically working with DataCite, because CDL is a full DataCite member. This <a class="ppt-link" href="http://www.cdlib.org/services/infrastructure/docs/EZIDEntityMap.pdf">diagram</a> may help explain the relationships.</p>
	<h3 class="heading_3">After the subscription is paid, then what?  How do users we want to sponsor get access?</h3>
  <p>Once the main account is set up, if you would like to sponsor other groups, then you would use the sponsored account order form to request new accounts. Please <a class="link__primary" href="/contact">contact us</a> for this form if you don't have it. In addition, we provide customizable <a class="link__primary" href="/learn#06">outreach materials and presentations</a> you can re-purpose to use at your institution.</p>
	<h3 class="heading_3">Who sets up accounts for groups? Who sets up accounts for individuals?</h3>
	<p>We take care of this for you, based on the information you provide on the forms mentioned above.</p>
	<h3 class="heading_3">We are working with a repository that is using EZID. How are the IDs issued by the repository related to EZID?</h3>
	<p>If you submit content to a repository or service working with EZID, the ARKs or DOIs it assigns come from EZID.</p>
	<h3 class="heading_3">Can EZID identifiers be related to the links in other systems?</h3>
	<p>EZID identifiers can be related to external links if you associate them with metadata, for example by using the relatedIdentifier field in the <a class="ext-link" href="http://schema.datacite.org/">DataCite metadata schema</a>.</p>
	<h3 class="heading_3">What is the best way to link to the DOIs and ARKs I create with EZID?</h3>
	<p>If you would like to include clickable links to DOIs and ARKs on a landing page, we recommend that you format them following this html template:</br>
	  <div class="pre-block">
	    <code>DOI: &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1234/ABCD">doi:10.1234/ABCD&lt/a&gt;</code></br>
	    <code>ARK: &lt;a href="http://n2t.net/ark:/12345/abcde">ark:/12345/abcde&lt/a&gt;</code></br>
	  </div>
	We discourage the practice of publishing or citing links to identifier management pages at <a class="link__primary" href="/">ezid.cdlib.org</a> because it is generally preferable for search engine crawlers to index resource (object) pages rather than pages of identifier administration details. In this way, users looking for data will be sure to find the landing pages you have prepared.</p>
	<h3 class="heading_3">We have a DSpace repository. Is it possible (or advisable) to apply EZID identifiers retrospectively or in the future for the content in our Dspace repository?</h3>
	<p>Because EZID has an API, it is possible to write code to interact with your Dspace repository.</p>
	<h3 class="heading_3">What happens when an account holder leaves our institution? Can he or she still update the DOI or ARK? If not, what must happen?</h3>
	<p>If an account-holder leaves your institution, please let us know so that we revoke their CREATE access to EZID. They will continue to be able to maintain all existing identifiers.</p>
	<h3 class="heading_3">What if research partners are not at our institution? Can they also use EZID for a project partially based at our institution?</h3>
	<p>If there is a researcher from your institution associated with the project, and if you want to sponsor the access, then we are okay with extending access. Please use the sponsored account order form (see above) to request the new account.</p>
	<h3 class="heading_3">Are we eligible to participate in your Crossref service?</h3>
	<p>As of August, 2017, only University of California clients are eligible to participate. Please <a class="link__primary" href="/contact">contact us</a> if you have questions about your existing Crossref service account.</p>
