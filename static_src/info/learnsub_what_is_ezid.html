  <h3 class="heading_2">What is EZID?</h3>
<p>EZID (easy-eye-dee) makes it easy for University of California (UC) scholars and researchers to create and manage
  long-term, globally unique identifiers for data and sources, ensuring their future discoverability. Use EZID to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create identifiers for anything: texts, data, bones, terms, etc.</li>
    <li>Manage your research objects more easily with shareable, unbreakable links</li>
    <li>Store citation information for the objects in a variety of formats</li>
    <li>Fit identifiers into your automated workflows with our standards-based API</li> 
  </ul>

  <h3 class="heading_2">Why use EZID?</h3>

  <h4 class="heading_3">Open data, open science, open access initiatives are spreading</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>EZID provides a great way to <strong>promote open sharing</strong>, because it allows the content creator to establish a permanent link to the object.</li>
    <li>When the object gets <strong>cited by others</strong>, even if is moved to a new location, <strong>the citation reference will always work</strong>, as long as the metadata is updated.</li>
    <li>EZID itself is built with open source components, and clients are contributing <a class="link__primary" href="/learn/open_source">open source add-ons</a> as well.</li>
    <li>EZID is also linked to Crossref, a huge benefit for UC's non-profit open-access publishers that want CrossRef services for their journals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="heading_3">Funders demand management, tracking, and use of identifiers</h4>
	<ul>
    <li>Using <strong>identifiers and data management plans</strong>, such as those provided by the
      <a href="https://dmptool.org" target="_blank">DMP Tool</a>, will save you time and resources in the long run.
      This planning helps to ensure that your data will be usable and discoverable in the future and complies
      with funder requirements.</li>
 	  <li><strong>EZID services can help.</strong> Contact your university library and <strong>ask for EZID</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
  <h4 class="heading_3">The changing role of the library, with scholarly communication evolving to include data</h4>
	<ul>
  	<li>As your Library develops data management and data curation services, you are looking for ways to <a class="link__primary" href="/learn#06">reach out</a> to scholars and meet their data-related needs.</li>
  	<li><strong>EZID is flexible, affordable and extensible, allowing the Library to sponsor access for all scholars on a campus.</strong></li>
  	<li>The Library can become known as the go-to place for data citation, data sharing, and data management.</li>
	</ul>
  <h4 class="heading_3">Storage has gone global</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>University of California researchers and staff can use EZID to register persistent identifiers for their
        research outputs, making them <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">findable,
        accessible, interoperable, and reusable</a>.
    </li>
    <li>You will appreciate the <strong>automated workflows</strong> available with EZID's easy
      <a class="link__primary" href="/doc/apidoc.html">application programming interface (API)</a>, its standards-based
      processes, and the <a class="link__primary" href="/learn#02">growing community of support.</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
