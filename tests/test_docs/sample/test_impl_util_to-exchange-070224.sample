    <description descriptionType=\"Abstract\">
      The article discusses the importance of objects of historical and cultural
      heritage of Voronezh (Russia). Monuments of history and culture are an
      important factor in the unity of the peoples of Russia, a means of
      unification in times of crises and catastrophes. In this sense, it can be
      argued that the Russian regional cultural heritage is a combination of the
      best achievements of national cultures of different peoples of Russia.
      Particular attention is paid to architectural buildings related to the
      life of the Russian Orthodox Church, in particular, city churches, houses
      of priests, office buildings, monuments of nature. All this historical and
      cultural heritage raises the question not only about clarifying the role
      and place of traditions, but also about the limited possibilities of using
      historical experience. In this regard, the relevance of the study and
      preservation of the cultural heritage of Voronezh is of particular value.

    <description descriptionType=\"Methods\">
      The study of Russian traditions of the protection of cultural heritage is
      based on a systematic approach that follows from the methodological
      principles of historical synergy. The National System for the Protection
      of Cultural Heritage is a process of a complex, unstable, dynamic,
      self-renewing approach to the system of protection of cultural heritage.
      Considering this, the traditions of the protection of cultural heritage as
      a system object were considered, firstly, through the structure of this
      object - the state and public subsystems (how these elements of the system
      are ordered, what hierarchy they form); secondly, through the functions of
      the components of the system of parts (the role of the element, the extent
      to which it is responsible for maintaining the stability of the system for
      identifying, studying, preserving and using the objects of the national
      cultural heritage, as well as its changes); thirdly, through the
      characterization of cultural heritage as a constantly becoming more
      complex information system, in which the protection of heritage appears,
      first of all, as a choice of information about its past, which is socially
      significant for a given historical period of time. Allocation of the most
      significant processes in the preservation and transmission of historical
      traditions was made possible through the use of the phenomenological
      method, which allowed to reveal the inner essence of the objects of
      cultural heritage and features of the gradations themselves.

      I. INTRODUCTION The collapse of the Soviet Union, the collapse of the
      communist ideology put the modern Russian society in the conditions of the
      search for new values and cultural landmarks, awareness of new boundaries
      of their identity. In a society that is in a situation of split and
      spiritual crisis, the mood of indifference and social apathy is growing
      more and more rapidly, the ideas of national and religious exclusiveness
      are spreading, social and national hatred is deepening, and aggression is
      growing. Understanding the significance of the cultural component, the
      role and place of cultural heritage both in substantiating historical
      choices and in the process of cultural-historical self-identification of
      Russian society is becoming more and more obvious in the context of an
      increasingly open and sharp confrontation between supporters and opponents
      of modern transformations in Russia. In modern conditions of existence and
      functioning of the world cultural heritage system, a question arises about
      the significance of the Russian experience in the protection of monuments.
      This system focuses us on the use of European standards for the protection
      of cultural heritage, which have already proven their effectiveness, which
      are not always applicable to the realities of the transition state of
      Russian society and are fraught with new losses of historical and cultural
      monuments. II. DISCUSSION The first generalization of the experience of
      the formation of Russian traditions of cultural heritage protection began
      under Peter I, during this period the first steps were taken to find and
      preserve Russian antiquities. A similar historiographical situation was
      caused by a number of circumstances: the relatively late formation of the
      most academic historical science in Russia; poor study of Russian
      territories in order to identify objects of history and culture; unclear
      selection criteria; In the stormy discussions that engulfed the educated
      strata of Russian society, the negativity in relation to the national
      cultural heritage of numerous historical and philosophical scientific
      societies has been overcome. A whole galaxy of specialists was prepared
      who, based on their own practical experience of participating in memorial
      defense activities, could formulate their immediate problems. After
      October 1917, there was an ideologization and the establishment of a party
      monopoly in state policy in the field of culture and the protection of
      cultural heritage. The Soviet concept of preserving monuments, established
      with the coming of the Bolsheviks to power, suggested that the
      overwhelming majority of monuments, as a product of the \u201ccursed past\u201d and
      the result of the activities of the exploiting classes, should not be
      preserved. Only the \u201cmonuments of revolutionary achievements\u201d, \u201cmonuments
      of national life\u201d and \u201cmonuments of the Red Army\u201d became the object of the
      preservation activity. This approach is reflected in the work of M.G.
      Khudyakova \u201cPre-Revolutionary Russian Archeology in the Service of the
      Exploiting Classes\u201d, as well as in a number of \u201cideologically sustained\u201d
      articles of the 1920s \u2013 1930s gm. In the USSR, after a long break in the
      late 1960s. the social movement for the protection of monuments was
      resumed, the All-Russian Society for the Protection of Monuments of
      History and Culture was created (1965), which immediately launched a broad
      scientific and publishing activity. Since 1972, the annual collection of
      articles \u201cMonuments of the Fatherland\u201d began to be published, and since
      1980, two times a year, the eponymous thematic Almanac of the All-Russian
      Society for the Preservation of Historical and Cultural Monuments (The
      World of Russian Estate, Monastic Revolution shrines of Moscow \").
      Having given a fairly complete picture of the historical experience of the
      Russian state in the field of the protection of cultural heritage in
      pre-revolutionary Russia, the author as a whole did not exhaust this
      topic. Outside the scope of the study, there remained the state solution
      to the problems of preserving movable monuments of history and culture,
      activities in the field of protecting monuments of individual statesmen
      and the scientific community, comparing Russian historical experience of
      protecting monuments of history and culture with the experience
      accumulated by foreign countries in the same period. III. RESULTS Special
      attention is attracted by the idea of forming protected historical and
      cultural territories, which can be historical cities, manor and monastery
      complexes, fields of historical battles, historical roads, historical
      production territories, etc. Such territories are already being created
      either in the form of museum reserves or other spatial entities, including
      specific administrative and territorial units (regions). Sometimes their
      activities can determine the future economic specialization of the region
      as a whole, the prospects for its socio-economic development. Heritage
      monuments are gradually recognized as a specific resource of the territory
      and act as a new active phenomenon of economic life. In recent years, the
      historical heritage is being evaluated in a new way, many previously
      forgotten names and historical events are being returned, religious
      monuments and shrines are being restored. For example, in Voronezh and the
      Voronezh region out of 2,730 objects of historical and cultural heritage
      of 260 churches (about 10%), which are located mainly in provincial
      counties (districts). This is a very important and reliable historical
      fact. This fact deserves the attention of historians and specialists in
      the field of culture. In fact, these are really monuments of regional
      significance, but there are also monuments of the federal level. In
      Voronezh, the Jewish Synagogue appeared only at the beginning of the 20th
      century; the Lutheran church appeared already in the first quarter of the
      19th century. Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, Judaism were the most common
      religions in this period.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

A significant factor in the life of the regions of Russia was the emergence of a significant number of publications on history,
local history, the study of the nature of the native land (these are reprints of old editions, as well as the publication of
unpublished manuscripts, and the appearance of new regional studies). Of particular importance was the concept of
\u201cheritage\u201d, which was almost never used a decade and a half ago. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Among the main trends of the post-
Soviet period, there is a noticeable transition from the protection of individual monuments to the preservation of the entire
natural and cultural heritage in its integrity, which covers both the heritage objects themselves and the environment in which
they exist. This includes efforts to identify the entire heritage, encompassing not only outstanding monuments of nature, history
and culture, but also other important elements: folk culture, traditions, crafts and handicrafts, historical urban environment,
rural development and settlement system, ethnocultural environment, Natural resources. environment, etc. All these phenomena are
considered as an immediate and integral part of the national cultural heritage, as special elements determining the identity of
the culture of a country or its region. A similar trend is actively developing among the monuments of nature, history and culture.
Work on the inventory of monuments in various regions of the country has expanded the existing lists of many new objects. They
included not only outstanding monuments of architecture, history, monumental art, but also numerous architectural structures of
the late XIX - early XX century. Special attention is paid to the unity of the architectural or historical ensemble.

on a land plot in the city of Voronezh at the address: Mechnikov lane house \u2116 22.\u00a0 In 1941 the Great Patriotic war
began. German troops captured the city of Voronezh. In 1943, the city of Voronezh was liberated from Nazi invaders. The front line
passed near the house on Mechnikov lane, 22. German tanks, passing through this land, destroyed three larch. The only tree
(pictured above) has survived to the present day and is a valuable example of the mother's seed, as well as a silent witness to
the fierce fighting for the city of Voronezh. Siberian larch has been the national tree of Russia since 1960. Represents Russia in
peoples ' Friendship Park (Seattle, USA). Larch is a symbol of longevity and rebirth. In 2015, the tree was examined by the
specialists of the Botanical garden named after Professor B. M. Kozo-Polyansky, Voronezh state University (Director of the
Botanical garden of Voronezh state University, candidate of agricultural Sciences, associate Professor of the Department of
ecology A. A. Voronin, the scientific employee of the Botanical garden of Voronezh state University, candidate of geographical
Sciences L. A. Lepeshkina, researcher at the Botanical garden of Voronezh state University, candidate of geographical Sciences,
associate Professor M. A. Klevtsova). Certification materials in 2015 (currently 81-year-old Siberian larch) were sent by
specialists to the national register of forest stands of the all-Russian program \"Trees-monuments of nature\". According to the
results of the attestation Commission, unique trees are given the status of a state-protected natural object. Another important
area of modern cultural development is the formation of a system of historical and cultural territories. This new trend in
cultural policy suggests a territorial approach to the preservation of heritage. The international community has long paid
attention to the state of its cultural heritage and preserves the unique territories of the natural environment. In addition to
the adoption of national lists of the most valuable and protected objects in the second half of the XX century. The task was to
preserve and render assistance to cultural monuments and natural territories within the framework of interstate programs. Since
1972, the World Heritage List has become a kind of universal heritage registry drawn up within the framework of the UNESCO
International Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. \u00a0 BELOW IS A TABLE, WHICH CONTAINS

the XX century, the country's economy began to form a market in the field of historical and cultural heritage, which can be called
one of the new economic phenomena. This is evident not only in the demand for something old, but also in many other trends. First
of all, it is a significant increase in the value of quotations of real estate and land directly related to the historical centers
of cities and historical places in General (and, often, this excess does not correspond directly to the infrastructure of the area
of historical development or modern economic development of the historical place). In the late 1990s. occurred the privatization
of the first monuments of nature, history and culture, and currently there is a sufficiently active market demand for historical
monuments and of the earth with the point of view of their lease and purchase. IV. CONCLUSION Preservation of monuments of
natural, historical and cultural heritage plays a special role in promoting the tourist brand of the territory. Because, often, it
is the heritage sites or attractions of the region that attract a large number of tourists. Thus, historical and cultural heritage
is an important factor in the socio-economic development of individual cities and territories, which can ensure the development of
the territory on the basis of the use of a certain resource. For a number of territories, the historical, cultural and natural
wealth of the region becomes one of the real opportunities for their economic and social development. REFERENCE LIST Ashmarov,

             '      The article discusses the importance of objects of '
             'historical and cultural
'
             '      heritage of Voronezh (Russia). Monuments of history and '
             'culture are an
'
             '      important factor in the unity of the peoples of Russia, a '
             'means of
'
             '      unification in times of crises and catastrophes. In this '
             'sense, it can be
'
             '      argued that the Russian regional cultural heritage is a '
             'combination of the
'
             '      best achievements of national cultures of different '
             'peoples of Russia.
'
             '      Particular attention is paid to architectural buildings '
             'related to the
'
             '      life of the Russian Orthodox Church, in particular, city '
             'churches, houses
'
             '      of priests, office buildings, monuments of nature. All '
             'this historical and
'
             '      cultural heritage raises the question not only about '
             'clarifying the role
'
             '      and place of traditions, but also about the limited '
             'possibilities of using
'
             '      historical experience. In this regard, the relevance of '
             'the study and
'
             '      preservation of the cultural heritage of Voronezh is of '
             'particular value.

'
             '      The study of Russian traditions of the protection of '
             'cultural heritage is
'
             '      based on a systematic approach that follows from the '
             'methodological
'
             '      principles of historical synergy. The National System for '
             'the Protection
'
             '      of Cultural Heritage is a process of a complex, unstable, '
             'dynamic,
'
             '      self-renewing approach to the system of protection of '
             'cultural heritage.
'
             '      Considering this, the traditions of the protection of '
             'cultural heritage as
'
             '      a system object were considered, firstly, through the '
             'structure of this
'
             '      object - the state and public subsystems (how these '
             'elements of the system
'
             '      are ordered, what hierarchy they form); secondly, through '
             'the functions of
'
             '      the components of the system of parts (the role of the '
             'element, the extent
'
             '      to which it is responsible for maintaining the stability '
             'of the system for
'
             '      identifying, studying, preserving and using the objects of '
             'the national
'
             '      cultural heritage, as well as its changes); thirdly, '
             'through the
'
             '      characterization of cultural heritage as a constantly '
             'becoming more
'
             '      complex information system, in which the protection of '
             'heritage appears,
'
             '      first of all, as a choice of information about its past, '
             'which is socially
'
             '      significant for a given historical period of time. '
             'Allocation of the most
'
             '      significant processes in the preservation and transmission '
             'of historical
'
             '      traditions was made possible through the use of the '
             'phenomenological
'
             '      method, which allowed to reveal the inner essence of the '
             'objects of
'
             '      cultural heritage and features of the gradations '
             'themselves.

             '      I. INTRODUCTION The collapse of the Soviet Union, the '
             'collapse of the
'
             '      communist ideology put the modern Russian society in the '
             'conditions of the
'
             '      search for new values and cultural landmarks, awareness of '
             'new boundaries
'
             '      of their identity. In a society that is in a situation of '
             'split and
'
             '      spiritual crisis, the mood of indifference and social '
             'apathy is growing
'
             '      more and more rapidly, the ideas of national and religious '
             'exclusiveness
'
             '      are spreading, social and national hatred is deepening, '
             'and aggression is
'
             '      growing. Understanding the significance of the cultural '
             'component, the
'
             '      role and place of cultural heritage both in substantiating '
             'historical
'
             '      choices and in the process of cultural-historical '
             'self-identification of
'
             '      Russian society is becoming more and more obvious in the '
             'context of an
'
             '      increasingly open and sharp confrontation between '
             'supporters and opponents
'
             '      of modern transformations in Russia. In modern conditions '
             'of existence and
'
             '      functioning of the world cultural heritage system, a '
             'question arises about
'
             '      the significance of the Russian experience in the '
             'protection of monuments.
'
             '      This system focuses us on the use of European standards '
             'for the protection
'
             '      of cultural heritage, which have already proven their '
             'effectiveness, which
'
             '      are not always applicable to the realities of the '
             'transition state of
'
             '      Russian society and are fraught with new losses of '
             'historical and cultural
'
             '      monuments. II. DISCUSSION The first generalization of the '
             'experience of
'
             '      the formation of Russian traditions of cultural heritage '
             'protection began
'
             '      under Peter I, during this period the first steps were '
             'taken to find and
'
             '      preserve Russian antiquities. A similar historiographical '
             'situation was
'
             '      caused by a number of circumstances: the relatively late '
             'formation of the
'
             '      most academic historical science in Russia; poor study of '
             'Russian
'
             '      territories in order to identify objects of history and '
             'culture; unclear
'
             '      selection criteria; In the stormy discussions that '
             'engulfed the educated
'
             '      strata of Russian society, the negativity in relation to '
             'the national
'
             '      cultural heritage of numerous historical and philosophical '
             'scientific
'
             '      societies has been overcome. A whole galaxy of specialists '
             'was prepared
'
             '      who, based on their own practical experience of '
             'participating in memorial
'
             '      defense activities, could formulate their immediate '
             'problems. After
'
             '      October 1917, there was an ideologization and the '
             'establishment of a party
'
             '      monopoly in state policy in the field of culture and the '
             'protection of
'
             '      cultural heritage. The Soviet concept of preserving '
             'monuments, established
'
             '      with the coming of the Bolsheviks to power, suggested that '
             'the
'
             '      overwhelming majority of monuments, as a product of the '
             '“cursed past” and
'
             '      the result of the activities of the exploiting classes, '
             'should not be
'
             '      preserved. Only the “monuments of revolutionary '
             'achievements”, “monuments
'
             '      of national life” and “monuments of the Red Army” became '
             'the object of the
'
             '      preservation activity. This approach is reflected in the '
             'work of M.G.
'
             '      Khudyakova “Pre-Revolutionary Russian Archeology in the '
             'Service of the
'
             '      Exploiting Classes”, as well as in a number of '
             '“ideologically sustained”
'
             '      articles of the 1920s – 1930s gm. In the USSR, after a '
             'long break in the
'
             '      late 1960s. the social movement for the protection of '
             'monuments was
'
             '      resumed, the All-Russian Society for the Protection of '
             'Monuments of
'
             '      History and Culture was created (1965), which immediately '
             'launched a broad
'
             '      scientific and publishing activity. Since 1972, the annual '
             'collection of
'
             '      articles “Monuments of the Fatherland” began to be '
             'published, and since
'
             '      1980, two times a year, the eponymous thematic Almanac of '
             'the All-Russian
'
             '      Society for the Preservation of Historical and Cultural '
             'Monuments (The
'
             '      World of Russian Estate, Monastic Revolution shrines of '
             'Moscow ").
'
             '      Having given a fairly complete picture of the historical '
             'experience of the
'
             '      Russian state in the field of the protection of cultural '
             'heritage in
'
             '      pre-revolutionary Russia, the author as a whole did not '
             'exhaust this
'
             '      topic. Outside the scope of the study, there remained the '
             'state solution
'
             '      to the problems of preserving movable monuments of history '
             'and culture,
'
             '      activities in the field of protecting monuments of '
             'individual statesmen
'
             '      and the scientific community, comparing Russian historical '
             'experience of
'
             '      protecting monuments of history and culture with the '
             'experience
'
             '      accumulated by foreign countries in the same period. III. '
             'RESULTS Special
'
             '      attention is attracted by the idea of forming protected '
             'historical and
'
             '      cultural territories, which can be historical cities, '
             'manor and monastery
'
             '      complexes, fields of historical battles, historical roads, '
             'historical
'
             '      production territories, etc. Such territories are already '
             'being created
'
             '      either in the form of museum reserves or other spatial '
             'entities, including
'
             '      specific administrative and territorial units (regions). '
             'Sometimes their
'
             '      activities can determine the future economic '
             'specialization of the region
'
             '      as a whole, the prospects for its socio-economic '
             'development. Heritage
'
             '      monuments are gradually recognized as a specific resource '
             'of the territory
'
             '      and act as a new active phenomenon of economic life. In '
             'recent years, the
'
             '      historical heritage is being evaluated in a new way, many '
             'previously
'
             '      forgotten names and historical events are being returned, '
             'religious
'
             '      monuments and shrines are being restored. For example, in '
             'Voronezh and the
'
             '      Voronezh region out of 2,730 objects of historical and '
             'cultural heritage
'
             '      of 260 churches (about 10%), which are located mainly in '
             'provincial
'
             '      counties (districts). This is a very important and '
             'reliable historical
'
             '      fact. This fact deserves the attention of historians and '
             'specialists in
'
             '      the field of culture. In fact, these are really monuments '
             'of regional
'
             '      significance, but there are also monuments of the federal '
             'level. In
'
             '      Voronezh, the Jewish Synagogue appeared only at the '
             'beginning of the 20th
'
             '      century; the Lutheran church appeared already in the first '
             'quarter of the
'
             '      19th century. Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, Judaism were the '
             'most common
'
             '      religions in this '

             'the emergence of a significant number of publications on '
             'history, local history, the study of the nature of the native '
             'land (these are reprints of old editions, as well as the '
             'publication of unpublished manuscripts, and the appearance of '
             'new regional studies). Of particular importance was the concept '
             'of “heritage”, which was almost never used a decade and a half '
             'ago. \xa0\xa0 \xa0Among the main trends of the post-Soviet '
             'period, there is a noticeable transition from the protection of '
             'individual monuments to the preservation of the entire natural '
             'and cultural heritage in its integrity, which covers both the '
             'heritage objects themselves and the environment in which they '
             'exist. This includes efforts to identify the entire heritage, '
             'encompassing not only outstanding monuments of nature, history '
             'and culture, but also other important elements: folk culture, '
             'traditions, crafts and handicrafts, historical urban '
             'environment, rural development and settlement system, '
             'ethnocultural environment, Natural resources. environment, etc. '
             'All these phenomena are considered as an immediate and integral '
             'part of the national cultural heritage, as special elements '
             'determining the identity of the culture of a country or its '
             'region. A similar trend is actively developing among the '
             'monuments of nature, history and culture. Work on the inventory '
             'of monuments in various regions of the country has expanded the '
             'existing lists of many new objects. They included not only '
             'outstanding monuments of architecture, history, monumental art, '
             'but also numerous architectural structures of the late XIX - '
             'early XX century. Special attention is paid to the unity of the '
             'architectural or historical '
             'ensemble. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 '

             'were planted on a land plot in the city of Voronezh at the '
             'address: Mechnikov lane house № 22.\xa0 In 1941 the Great '
             'Patriotic war began. German troops captured the city of '
             'Voronezh. In 1943, the city of Voronezh was liberated from Nazi '
             'invaders. The front line passed near the house on Mechnikov '
             'lane, 22. German tanks, passing through this land, destroyed '
             'three larch. The only tree (pictured above) has survived to the '
             "present day and is a valuable example of the mother's seed, as "
             'well as a silent witness to the fierce fighting for the city of '

             "since 1960. Represents Russia in peoples ' Friendship Park "
             '(Seattle, USA). Larch is a symbol of longevity and rebirth. In '
             '2015, the tree was examined by the specialists of the Botanical '
             'garden named after Professor B. M. Kozo-Polyansky, Voronezh '
             'state University (Director of the Botanical garden of Voronezh '

             'national register of forest stands of the all-Russian program '
             '"Trees-monuments of nature". According to the results of the '
             'attestation Commission, unique trees are given the status of a '
             'state-protected natural object. Another important area of modern '
             'cultural development is the formation of a system of historical '
             'and cultural territories. This new trend in cultural policy '

             'Shilovo village In the last years of the XX century, the '
             "country's economy began to form a market in the field of "
             'historical and cultural heritage, which can be called one of the '
             'new economic phenomena. This is evident not only in the demand '
             'for something old, but also in many other trends. First of all, '
             'it is a significant increase in the value of quotations of real '
             'estate and land directly related to the historical centers of '
             'cities and historical places in General (and, often, this excess '
             'does not correspond directly to the infrastructure of the area '
             'of historical development or modern economic development of the '
             'historical place). In the late 1990s. occurred the privatization '
             'of the first monuments of nature, history and culture, and '
             'currently there is a sufficiently active market demand for '
             'historical monuments and of the earth with the point of view of '
             'their lease and purchase. IV. CONCLUSION Preservation of '
             'monuments of natural, historical and cultural heritage plays a '
             'special role in promoting the tourist brand of the territory. '
             'Because, often, it is the heritage sites or attractions of the '
             'region that attract a large number of tourists. Thus, historical '
