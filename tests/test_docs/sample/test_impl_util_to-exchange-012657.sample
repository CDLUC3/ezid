descriptionType=\"Abstract\" xml:lang=\"en\"> The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on
the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology,
vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects
of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term
monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and
function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes turnover plot data,
collected as part of the vegetation section of MERP.
\tDetermination of aquatic macrophyte annual net primary production is vital to the understanding of the dynamics of freshwater
marshes. Macrophyte biomass, both live and dead, is a major storage compartment for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in a marsh and
a major potential energy and nutrient source for the faunal component of the marsh ecosystem. Macrophyte communities are also
essential structural components of the habitat of both invertebrates and vertebrates. The major objective of the long-term
monitoring of aquatic macrophytes was to determine the impact of the wet-dry cycle on macrophyte above and belowground net annual
production. Standard harvest techniques were used because they were the most direct, simple and reliable techniques available for
estimating net annual primary production of macrophytes per unit area (van der Valk, 1989). Sampling for aboveground macrophyte
production occurred once in late July or early August during the sampling season, as this is the period where standing emergents
reach their maximum standing crop. The appearance of fully-grown Typha sp. was generally used to gauge if macrophytes had reached
their maximum standing crop. Both clip plot (MAGs; contained in a separate data package on the KNB) and turn-over plot (TOPs)
methods were used to estimate aboveground production (van der Valk, 1989). As a single harvesting method would underestimate net
primary productivity, turnover plots were used to correct the data.
