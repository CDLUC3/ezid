could not be steered into the proper position, sinking before this could be accomplished. The Spanish flotilla, in the channel

passing the Merrimac and slipping out to the open sea under cover of darkness on July 3, 1898, one month after the Merrimac had
gone down. As Cervera got his ships out of the harbor, He ordered the Mercedes sunk in an effort to keep the Americans out of the
harbor, but because of American shells, his ship-sinking did no better than the Americans in the matter of placing. The Spaniards
were overhauled by the Americans outside the harbor mouth and their ships shelled, setting fire to the wooden decks which caused
the Spaniards to beach the ships and abandon them in order to save their men who were subsequently taken prisoners by Cuban force
near by.
