to give the best in educational and research facilities. The building contains cold storage laboratories, teaching laboratories, a
tropical incubator room, several small utility laboratories, food preparation labs and kitchens, food tasting and acceptance labs,
and a pilot wing where research under simulated commercial conditions can be conducted. The wing ultimately will be outfitted with
machinery and equipment for duplicating any process used by the food industry. The cold storage and incubator rooms enable
technologists to observe the effects of fresh and processed foods under long and short term storage at greatly varied conditions.
The incubator room will also be used for culturing yeasts, bacteria and viruses for experimental work."}
