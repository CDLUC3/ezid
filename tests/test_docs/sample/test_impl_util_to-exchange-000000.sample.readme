The test_impl_util_to-exchange-ID.sample files were created for testing
the impl_util_to-exchange() function which performs metadata format conversion.
Metadata schema version such as DataCite version 3, 4 etc. has no impact to the test results.
So there is no need to update these test datasets following DataCite schema upgrade.

Sample content of the test file:

input_json=
{}
~~~~~~~~~~
dict_pp=
{}
~~~~~~~~~~
keys=

output_exchange=
