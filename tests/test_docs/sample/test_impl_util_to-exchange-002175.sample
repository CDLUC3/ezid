his gang robbed a fur store at Cleveland, Ohio, was arrested for this crime at Allegheny City, Pa. Two officers from Cleveland
were sent for him and started home on the train with him, he being handcuffed to Detective Wm. Hulligan. The train was boarded by
a gang lead by an ex-convict Blinkey Morgan who assaulted the two officers, crushing the skull of one of the officers and killing
Detective McHulligan. They then released Kennedy. Blinkey Morgan was arrested in Canada for this crime and tried and hanged for it

Cleveland Police. The State of Ohio refused to send for him and he was let go. He remained in Australia for a number of years,
spending most of his time in jail and he was at last forced to leave and return to the United States where he traveled with a gang
all over the States, committing burglary and robbery. At last he left for Europe and a trip around the world. He kept the police
of the world on the go, but they never could convict him. The next he was heard from was when he was killed by Officer Le Strange
of the Berkeley Police on September 28th, 1905. He, with four others were attempting to rob a bank at Berkeley, California. He was
a very handsome crook and was known as Raffles among the crooked fraternity. He paid his expenses twice around the world by
robbing people. He was one of the last men in the world who, from his appearance, would ever be taken for a crook. The career of
this man reads like a romance. He was one of the typical swell burglars of olden days. Commenting on his death Mr. Wm. Pinkerton
said \"He lived by the sword and he died by the sword.\"
