Note and caution: all files in this directory whose names end with
.html, .py, or .sh are served by the EZID server.

The tools in this directory (i.e., the files ending with .py or .sh)
are replicated in https://github.com/CDLUC3/ezid-client-tools, and the
API documentation links to the tools there and not in EZID.  There is
currently no automated means of updating GitHub from this repository
(but there ought to be).

ezid.py is essentially identical to PROJECT_ROOT/tools/client, except
that it excludes several administrative features not of interest to
general clients.
