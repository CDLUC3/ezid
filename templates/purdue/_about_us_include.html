<h1>The EZID Service</h1>

<p>
	EZID is a service of the Purdue University Libraries
	that allows creators and publishers of data and other
	digital content to obtain persistent identifiers for
	their work. It allows researchers to register their
	data sets and assign unique, persistent identifiers to
	them.  This makes data easier to locate, identify, and cite.
