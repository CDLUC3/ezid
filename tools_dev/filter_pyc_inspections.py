"""Filter inspections exported from PyCharm

This can be used to pick out inspection issues that match some pattern and process them
as a batch.

Usage:
    - Run inspections in PyCharm
    - In the Inspection Results, Export > Export to XML
    - Only the output dir is selectable, not the the filename. That's because
    PyCharm uses the filename to recognize the type of XML file.
    - Add code in this script to filter the inspections
    - Import the file in PyCharm with 'View Offline Inspection Results'. (The title is
    misleading -- after import, the XML doc shows up as a regular inspection result with
    full functionality)
