"while augmenting access to your material through incoming links from other "
"publishers.&quot;</p> <p>To be specific, for most open access journal "
"publishers, the number one benefit is the inclusion of their journal's "

"\"http://www.crossref.org/01company/08affiliates.html#cms_affiliates\" class="

"identifiers you have assigned. The pool of possible identifiers (names) that "
"start with your prefix or your NAAN is called a <em>namespace</em>.</p> "
"<p>What are shoulders for? A shoulder actually reserves another namespace "
"inside (a subset of) the overall namespace for the prefix or NAAN. This is a "
"recommended precaution because later on you can ask that new shoulders be "
"created as your naming practices change or are delegated to sub-"
"organizations. Some accounts will be assigning millions of identifiers and "
"this helps avoid collisions among their own names. Other accounts may wish "
"both to be able to use the default account set up (shoulder plus generator) "
"and to assign names directly after the prefix or NAAN (as if there were no "
"shoulder).</p> <p>EZID clients are using shoulders in interesting ways, to "
"distinguish objects from different</p> <ul> <li>collections,</li> <li>data "
"sources,</li> <li>projects,</li> <li>departments,</li> <li>and so on.</li> </"
"ul> <p>In other words, shoulders are a great way to <em>manage an identifier "
"namespace</em>. It's helpful, however, if shoulders are &quot;opaque&quot;.</"
"p> <span id=\"IdentifierBasics-opacity\"></span> <h2 class="
"\"heading_2\">Opacity and Branding</h2> <p>Opacity in this context means the "
"absence of semantics (recognizable meaning) in the identifier string. The "
"principle is that it is important for the longevity of an identifier to "
"avoid semantics that are subject to change. There is a tradeoff too, in that "
"opaque identifiers may be a little harder to curate.</p> <p>A major reason "
"why many URLs created in the past now result in 404 (&quot;Not Found&quot;) "
"errors is due to semantics about the object being embedded in identifiers. "
"In general, the more transient and extrinsic the semantic &quot;"
"assertion&quot; in the identifier the string, the more vulnerable it will be "
"to semantic &quot;rot&quot;. For example, it is common practice to "
"incorporate an organization name into an object identifier or shoulder, and "
"this is a problematic precisely because the curating organization is "
"typically very transient and <strong>not</strong> an integral attribute of "
"an object. There is nothing within or about a spreadsheet that has been "
"deposited in a particular custodial institution that is intrinsic to the "
"spreadsheet and its data. Not only do institutions change names, but "
"tomorrow there might be a different custodian.</p> <p>While leaving a &quot;"
"brand&quot; name out of identifiers can seem like a hard choice, we remind "
"users that your globally unique prefix or NAAN contains the same "
"information; services that track identifier usage and impact factors (e.g., "
"Thomson Reuters Data Citation Index) make it their business to take globally "
"unique organization numbers and make organization names and their "
"identifiers visible.</p> <p>Semantics are more acceptable if they are "
"intrinsic to the object being registered. For example, if a data granule "
"covers a particular date, it is standard practice to incorporate that date "
"into the granule's filename and/or identifier. That works because the "
"coverage date is never going to change. If a granule has data for "
"2013-06-05, it will always have data for 2013-06-05.</p> <p>For these "
"reasons, we recommend our clients avoid branding in identifiers and "
"shoulders. However, you, of course, make this determination for yourselves. "
"If you would like to implement or request branding in the shoulder, then we "
"recommend that you choose a combination that follows these conventions:</p> "
"<ul> <li>It starts with one or more letters (for DOIs they must be uppercase "
"and for ARKs we strongly recommend lowercase).</li> <li>It ends with a digit."
"</li> <li>It contains neither vowels nor the letter 'l' (ell).</li> </ul> "
"<p>The above guidelines help us to maintain identifiers and to detect "
"transcription errors in identifier strings that we generate for you. If "
"these considerations are not so important to you, or if you are supplying "
"the identifier strings yourself (i.e., you do not need the identifier "
"generator), you may disregard these recommendations.</p> <p>The bottom line "
"is that more opaque your identifiers are, the less prone they will be to a "
"number of common age-related problems; if you want to introduce semantics "
"for easier curation, it is best to avoid meaning that is either transient, "
"extrinsic to the object, or widely recognizable.</p> <h2 class="

"<p>This document specifies identifier-related terms, conventions, and "
"practices as observed at the California Digital Library (CDL) in support of "
"the following roles.</p> <ol> <li>Providing the EZID (easy eye-dee) "
"identifier management service, which lets users create and manage DOIs, "
"ARKs, and (soon) identifiers of other types.</li> <li>Hosting the Name-to-"
"Thing (N2T) resolver, which redirects all identifiers managed by EZID as "
"well as a variety of identifier types, including LSID, LSRN, Handle, DOI, "
"and some classes of URN.</li> <li>Maintaining the primary instance of the "
"Name Assigning Authority Number (NAAN) registry, which is replicated at the "
"US National Library of Medicine and at the National Library of France.</li> "
"<li>Serving as maintenance agency for the Archival Resource Key (ARK) scheme."
"</li> </ol> <p>Many of the conventions arose in the context of ARK "
"identifiers, but they apply broadly across mainstream identifiers, including "
"URLs, DOIs, URNs, and Handles.  Unless otherwise specified, the conventions "
"here apply to all identifiers whose creation we support.</p> <h2 class="
"\"heading_2\">Terminology</h2> <p>The main concepts covered include:</p> "
"<ol> <li>Name Assigning Authority Numbers (NAANs) identifying large "
"institutional namespaces.</li> <li>NAAN &quot;shoulder&quot; extensions "
"identifying sub-namespaces.</li> <li>Name Mapping Authority (NMA) services "
"that accept names and return information about them</li> <li>Name resolution "
"(&quot;resolver&quot;) services, a special class of NMA services.</li> </ol> "
"<p>The terminology that follows is based on the metaphor of a key (or name "
"or identifier) in the context of locksmithing jargon.</p> <img src=\"/static/"
"images/learn_id_concepts_example.png\" alt=\"Diagram describing Cover, Bow, "
"Shoulder, Blade, and Tip of a key, and how this illusatrates Name Mapping "
"Authority and the Base Identifier\" /> <h2 class=\"heading_2\">NAANs and "
"shoulders</h2> <p>A core concept is that of the NAAN (Name Assigning "
"Authority), which identifies an organization that creates or assigns "
"identifiers.  The combination of scheme name and NAAN (together comprising "
"the &quot;bow&quot; of a  physical  key) is immutable.  The NAAN is usually "
"a number, but in the URN identifier scheme it is  often a string of "
"letters.  Numeric NAANs are more opaque and may  therefore be less "
"susceptible than non-opaque names to &quot;semantic rot&quot;  over the long "
"term. The intention behind the NAAN is to assign it at the highest  level "
"practical within one memory organization, such as a national library, a "
"national archive, or a university campus. </p> <p>Beginning every identifier "
"assigned by an organization, a NAAN defines its <em>namespace</em>, or the "
"pool of identifiers (sharing that NAAN) that it has or may potentially "
"assign.  It is common for a large organization with a NAAN to delegate name "
"assignment to semi-autonomous organizational units, typically &quot;"
"departments&quot;.</p> <p>To prevent accidental creation of non-unique names "
"between them, each unit is often assigned its own <em>shoulder</em>, which "
"is a NAAN extension corresponding to the &quot;shoulder&quot; of a physical "
"key.  The shoulder then begins every identifier assigned by the given unit, "
"defining its <em>sub-namespace</em>.  Unique shoulders guarantee that names "
"unique within the sub-namespace will also be unique outside of it, and the "
"unit need only focus on creating the rest of the key in a way that is "
"unique.  While the NAAN and shoulder are fixed for a given unit, the rest of "
"the key, known as the <em>blade</em>, is different for every identifier in "
"the unit's sub-namespace.</p> <h2 class=\"heading_2\">The &quot;First "
"Digit&quot; shoulder convention</h2> <p>An easy way to extend the NAAN with "
"a shoulder so that one will always have an unlimited supply of non-"
"conflicting shoulders is to adhere to the &quot;first digit&quot; "
"convention.  In this case each shoulder is a string of one of more letters "
"ending in a digit  (inclusive).  For example, &quot;ark:/13030/b3th89n&quot; "
"would have fixed shoulder prefix &quot;b3&quot;, and the 13030 NAAN could "
"then enjoy an infinite set of potential future shoulders, including,</p> "
"<p>   b3, c3, d3, ...<br /> bb3, bc3, bd3, ..., cb3, cc3, cd3, ...<br /> "
"bbb3, bbc3, bbd3, ..., bcb3, bcd3, ..., cbb3, cbc3, ...<br /> ...</p> <h2 "
"class=\"heading_2\">EZID support for NAANs and shoulders</h2> <p>An "
"organization is free to manage its shoulders and identifiers in any way that "
"it wishes, and the EZID service can significantly reduce the infrastructural "
"burden of that management for those who choose to use it.  This section "
"pertains to EZID function and policy current at the time of writing.</p> "
"<p>An EZID user account is first set up with one (or several) NAAN+shoulder "
"combinations under which the user can create identifiers. While there is in "
"principle an unlimited number of shoulders under the &quot;first digit&quot; "
"convention, each additional shoulder is not without cost, especially if "
"there is a &quot;minter&quot; (a small identifier generating database) "
"associated with it.  Also, although it may be convenient for assigning "
"organizations to use different shoulders for different object collections, "
"this practice promotes attachments to thematic or administrative object "
"groupings that are frequently very transient; over the long-term, a widening "
"gap between what a shoulder used to &quot;mean&quot; and what it currently "
"suggests (unintentionally) creates pressure to abandon older identifiers.  "
"EZID discourages practices that destabilize identifiers by making them "
"needlessly costly or hard to maintain.</p> <p>The EZID user interface also "
"permits you to choose the form of  the identifier <em>after</em> the "
"shoulder, which may be confusing.  In fact we  recommend that you let the "
"system generate new identifiers for you, as  we can guarantee that the &quot;"
"blade&quot; it generates will make for an identifier that is unique and "
"opaque.  EZID strongly discourages placing brand strings in identifier "
"blades because successor organizations, which tend to be former competitors, "
"will often be motivated to extinguish your brand rather than honor previous "
"name assignments.  Branding is most appropriately placed in the NMA, "
"described next.</p> <h2 class=\"heading_2\">Name Mapping Authority (NMA) "
"services</h2> <p>The protocol and hostname combination (e.g., <a href="
"\"http://OwlBike.example.org/\" class=\"link__primary\">http://OwlBike."
"example.org/</a>) may be thought of as a key cover (a plastic accessory, "
"sometimes known as a &quot;key identifier&quot;, that slips over the key and "
"makes it easy to find).  This metaphorical &quot;cover&quot;, which does not "
"alter the key's core identity, and is usually disposable and replaceable, "
"serves to make the key actionable when  embedded in a URL.  As such it "
"identifies an <em>NMA</em> (Name Mapping Authority) because it is a service "
"that accepts a name as input and returns (&quot;maps&quot; it to) such "
"things as object content, object metadata, object policies, etc.  Any given "
"identifier will have exactly one NAAN but may have more than one NMA (at a "
"time or over time).</p> <p>Multiple serial and simultaneous &quot;name "
"mapping&quot; (hosting) arrangements are common, but some NMAs are meant to "
"be long-term stable, including <a href=\"http://n2t.net/\" class=\"ext-link"
"\">http://n2t.net/</a>, <a href=\"http://handle.net/\" class=\"ext-link"
"\">http://handle.net/</a>, and <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/\" class=\"ext-"
"link\">http://dx.doi.org/</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"heading_2\">Resolution<br "
"class=\"atl-forced-newline\" /></h2> <p>In general, a Name Mapping Authority "
"(NMA) can be a starting place  for internet resolution, an ending place for "
"it, or both.  The main  requirement for being an NMA for an object is being "
"able to take a  request associated with its identifier and do something "
"useful with it  (to &quot;map&quot; it to a practical function), such as "
"providing access to the  object or its metadata, or forwarding the request "
"to another NMA.  Often  an NMA will provide object access for some requests "
"and forwarding services for  others. <br class=\"atl-forced-newline\" /></p> "
"<p>A broadly helpful practice is for NMAs to forward completely unknown  "
"identifier requests to a root resolver such as n2t.net, which can work  with "
"many identifier scheme (described below).  With very little burden  to the "
"original NMA, this practice increases the chances that resolution  will be "
"successful no matter where the user starts it. <br class=\"atl-forced-newline"
"\" /></p> <p>ARKs, URLs, and PURLs use manifest, scheme-agnostic redirecting "
"HTTP  servers as NMAs.  The DOI, Handle, and URN schemes are each designed "
"to  use an implicit, scheme-specific root resolver (NMA) with its own  "
"protocol.  Resolution in all these cases relies on a final HTTP access. <br "
"class=\"atl-forced-newline\" /></p> <h2 class=\"heading_2\">N2T (Name-to-"
"Thing) resolver<br class=\"atl-forced-newline\" /></h2> <p>The N2T (Name-to-"
"Thing) resolver is rooted at <a href=\"http://n2t.net/\" class=\"ext-link"
"\">http://n2t.net</a> and administered by the California Digital Library.  "
"It resolves ARKs, DOIs, Handles, LSIDs, LSRNs, and some classes of   URNs, "
"and we plan to expand its range of identifier types.  The EZID   service, "
"which populates a portion of the N2T resolver database, can be used to "
"create and manage ARKs and DOIs, and we plan to expand its range as well. "
"<br class=\"atl-forced-newline\" /></p> <p>N2T was originally designed for "
"global resolution of ARK identifiers,  but it is general enough to apply to "
"identifiers from any scheme.  It's  NAAN mapping mechanism is functionally "
"equivalent to and much simpler than the DOI, Handle, and  URN resolution "
"mechanisms. <br class=\"atl-forced-newline\" /></p> <h2 class="
"\"heading_2\">Opacity</h2> <p>Many of the terms in this document serve "
"semantic opacity, which is useful in creating identifiers that age and "
"travel well.  Opacity is often balanced by the insertion of hints in "
"replaceable appendages to the base, such as NMA branding before it and "
"extensions (after it) that suggest current service offerings.</p> <p>Perfect "
"opacity in identifiers is not as important as identifiers' having semantics "
"that are <em>not widely recognizable</em>, even if those semantics may "
"support administrative activity by specialists (cf. ISBNs).  In fact a "
"numeric NAAN does disclose the original naming authority, but only if you "
"have the NAAN registry handy, and a shoulder discloses a naming sub-"
"authority if you understand the &quot;first digit&quot; convention below and "
"have a registry of shoulders handy.  For the purposes of longevity, however, "
"it is critical that attachments to authority and sub-authority names (NAANs "
"and shoulders) be avoided; it is common for political pressures to require "
"sacrificing identifiers created out of short-sighted administrative or "
"branding convenience.</p> <h2 class=\"heading_2\">Test identifier "
"conventions</h2> <p>As an important exception to opacity, it is often "
"necessary to use identifiers in testing workflows, and because it is easy "
"for test identifiers to &quot;escape&quot; into the wild, we follow certain "
"conventions to prevent them from being interpreted as real identifiers if "
"users mistakenly try to use them.  Any identifier beginning with the NAAN, "
"&quot;99999&quot; will be considered a test identifier.  Furthermore, any "
"identifier beginning with the shoulder &quot;fk&quot; will also usually be "
"considered a test identifier.</p> <h2 class=\"heading_2\">Base identifier "
"extensions</h2> <p>An identifier frequently appears with an extension added "
"to its base.  For every assigned base identifier, there is in principle an "
"infinite number of extended forms.  In practice, the NAA may not officially "
"list all its extended forms publically.  Moreover, many extended forms are "
"created and publicized by NMAs independent of the NAA assignments.</p> "
"<p>Still more extended forms are discovered by users exploring an NMA's "
"services, for example, by noticing identifier patterns and changing some of "
"the values.  Names designed so that logical changes have logical "
"consequences have been called &quot;hackable identifiers&quot;.  Also, "
"sometimes an NMA supports substitution of &quot;parameters&quot; (values) "
"inside of query strings appended to its identifiers (after a &quot;?&quot;), "
"in order to produce certain documented effects.</p> <p>Identifier schemes "
"tend to specify little beyond the form of the NAAN (or other designation for "
"the NAA, sometimes called a Name Authority).  The ARK scheme permits formal "
"disclosure of hierarchy and equivalence in name extensions; if used in an "
"ARK, '/' indicates containment and '.' indicates variation.  For example,</"
"p> <p> ark:/13030/tqb3kh8z/                         # names an object "
"containing...<br /> ark:/13030/tqb3kh8z/chap3                # that in turn "
"contains...<br /> ark:/13030/tqb3kh8z/chap3/fig5.jpg    # that is a variant "
"of...<br /> ark:/13030/tqb3kh8z/chap3/fig5.pdf    # and so forth</p> <h2 "
"class=\"heading_2\">The &quot;Noid1&quot; Check Character Convention</h2> "
"<p>Check characters, if included at all, often protect only formally "
"published identifiers, such as the base identifier with no extensions.  "
"Check characters lengthen whatever sub-string they protect by at least one "
"character, so protecting all sub-string extensions could create fairly long "
"identifiers.  Also, check character generation is a deliberate process that "
"can conflict with the need for rapid and flexible creation of extensions.</"
"p> <p>One useful check character convention, called &quot;Noid1&quot;, uses "
"exactly one check character that appears at the tip of the blade, in other "
"words, as the last character of the base identifier.  It also uses the Noid1 "
"algorithm ( <a href=\"https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/NOID\" "
"class=\"ext-link\">https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/NOID</a> ), "
"which guarantees the base identifier against the most common transcription "
"errors: transposition of two adjacent characters and single character "
"errors.  Noid1 does not protect either the hostname or any extensions.  For "
"example, in the identifier,</p> <div class=\"code panel pdl\" style=\"border-"
"width: 1px;\"><div class=\"codeContent panelContent pdl\"> "
"<pre> ,------------, http://OwlBike.example.org/hdl:13030/tqb3kh8w/chap3/"
"fig5.jpg </pre> </div></div> <p>the protected string, &quot;13030/"
"tqb3kh8w&quot;, ends with a &quot;w&quot; that is (hypothetically) the "
"computed Noid1 check character.  Also, all Noid1 examples use a restricted "
"character repertoire consisting of digits and lowercase letters minus vowels "
"and minus the letter 'l' (ell).  The Noid software uses this repertoire to "
"reduce the chance of &quot;accidental&quot; semantics in generated "
"identifiers and to avoid some of the confusion that arises over mistaking "
"digits for letters, such as '1' for 'l' and '0' for 'O'.</p>"

"style=\"white-space:nowrap\">Suffix Passthrough (SPT)</span> is a feature "
"that lets you add any suffix to an identifier, and when a user selects "

"namespace&quot;. Any user-added suffix, which is a common way to form sub-"
"object identifiers, will be passed through to the registered target object.  "
"For example, a dataset with 10,000 component parts and just this one &quot;"
"ancestor&quot; ARK,</p> <pre class=\"literal-block\"> http://n2t.net/"
"ark:/12345/x98765 </pre> <p>would effectively allow access to 10,000 ARKs, "
"but only require you to manage the ancestor ARK. Those sub-object ARKs might "
"look like:</p> <pre class=\"literal-block\"> http://n2t.net/ark:/12345/"
"x98765/study1/location1/day1.cs http://n2t.net/ark:/12345/x98765/study1/"
"location3/day19.cs ... http://n2t.net/ark:/12345/x98765/study92/location18/"
"day96.xlsx </pre> <p>When a user clicks on one, it is submitted to N2T. "
"Failing to find it registered, N2T scans backwards starting from the end of "
"the user-supplied ARK string and stops at the first ancestor ARK that is "
"registered.</p> <p>The part that was scanned over, stretching from the first "
"registered ancestor ARK to the end of the original string, comprises the "
"suffix.</p> <pre class=\"literal-block\"> http://n2t.net/ark:/12345/"
"x98765<span style=\"color: red;\">/study92/location18/day96.xlsx</span> "
"______________________________<em>/\\</em>____________________________/ "
"ancestor ARK                      <span style=\"color: red;\">suffix</span> "
"</pre> <p>Then it redirects the user's browser to the ancestor's target URL, "
"appending the suffix that it scanned. So if the ancestor ARK's target was,</"
"p> <pre class=\"literal-block\"> http://n2t.net/ark:/12345/x98765  --&gt;  "
"<span style=\"color: blue;\">http://datazoo.example.com/carbon288</span> "
"\\______________________________<em>/     \\_</"

"ARK                          <span style=\"color: blue;\">ancestor ARK's "

"span></pre> <p>Note that SPT is only useful when the target server can "
"respond to the suffixes it receives. For example, you would not instruct "
"users how to add suffixes to the above ARK unless the target server was "
"prepared to provide access to its 10,000 sub-objects. Fortunately, SPT is "
"easy to illustrate in some cases, such as when the target server extends "
"resource names with query strings or ordinary URL paths.</p> <pre class="
"\"literal-block\"> <strong><em>Rule: if identifier A has target <span style="
"\"color: blue;\">T</span>, suffix passthrough means the extended identifier "
"A/<span style=\"color: red;\">X</span> has target<span style=\"color: blue;"
"\">T</span>/<span style=\"color: red;\">X</span></em></strong>.</pre> "
"<p>Using more words, for an identifier A stored in N2T that has the target "
"URL T, if you add a suffix X to A and resolve (eg, click on) the URL A/X, "
"you will be redirected to the URL T/X.</p> <p>Some limitations and "
"exceptions apply. For example, during the backwards scan, potential ancestor "
"ARKs are tested (to see if they are registered) only at each &quot;"
"word&quot; boundary, where a word here means a string of letters and digits. "
"Also, scanning stops when the NAAN (the 5-digit number after the &quot;ark:/"
"&quot;) is reached.</p> <h2 class=\"heading_2\">Suffix Passthrough Examples</"
"h2> <p>You can see SPT in action by clicking on the extended ARKs below. "
"These are &quot;ARKs&quot; (for illustration purposes only, not long-term "
"stable) that <em> are not</em> registered in the <a href=\"http://n2t.net\" "
"class=\"external-link\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color: blue;\">N2T</"
"span></a> resolver, but are formed by adding a <span style=\"color: red;"
"\">suffix</span> to an ARK that <em>is</em> registered.</p> <p>Example 1. "
"One registration standing in for several CDL service page &quot;ARKs&quot;.</"
"p> <ul> <li>Registered: ark:/12345/fk1234</li> <li>Its target URL: <a href="
