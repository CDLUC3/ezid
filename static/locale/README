Internationalization (i18n)
===========================

i18n file production command (run from home dir):

    django-admin.py makemessages --locale=fr_CA --ignore=node_modules/*

This generates a Portable Objectfile (PO) named 'django.po' in the locale directory
as defined by LOCALE_PATHS in common.py. To fully offer the site in another language,
this file must first be appended with the translated snippets.

As of April 2017, i18n (translated text and activation of a language chooser for user)
has not been implemented for EZID UI.
