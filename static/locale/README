Internationalization (i18n)
===========================

i18n file production command (run from home dir):

    django-admin.py makemessages --locale=fr_CA --ignore=node_modules/*

This generates a Portable Objectfile (PO) named 'django.po' in the locale
directory as defined by LOCALE_PATHS in common.py. To fully offer the site in
another language, this file must first be appended with the translated snippets.

As of April 2017, i18n (translated text and activation of a language chooser for
user) has not been implemented for EZID UI.

Until EZID requires i18n, makemessages doesn't need to be run.

To make EZID fully i18n-ized for a given language, translation must first be
applied to this django.po file.

Also, whenever any wording changes on the site:
  1) Run makemessages - this updates the master django.po file.
  2) Have a translation service add translation to all of the changes and have
     this translation applied to the file.

For the record, we couldn't easily apply i18n tags to the restructured text
of the API documentation, so that translation process would have to go a bit
differently. Process would also be different for anything not presented as HTML
(PDFs used for "quickstart" help documentation located on the ID creation pages).
