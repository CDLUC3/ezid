I had set up /ezid/etc as a local git repo prior to hand editting configs by
ezid devs.  see ezid-etc-git-diff for changes after initial install

(ezid) ezid@uc3-ezidui01x2-prd:14:30:59:~/etc$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   ezid_env.sh
	modified:   httpd/conf.d/03-ezid-nossl.conf
	modified:   httpd/conf/httpd.conf
	modified:   init.d/httpd



And here is list of altered files in ezid repo /ezid/ezid:

(ezid) ezid@uc3-ezidui01x2-prd:14:32:55:~/ezid$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

see ezid-impl-git-diff and ezid-settings-git-diff for details.
I did not take a diff on master_shoulders.txt.  This looks auto-generated.



Dave made a PR into this repo where he resolved many of the issues found under /ezid/etc.
the PR diff is ezid-ansible-pr-diff
