========= Front-End Stylesheets for WEB UI presentation layer ===========

This directory contains the SASS[1] stylesheets developed in the 1st phase of the EZID
UI Redesign. This design phase was more bootstrap dependent. A certain portion of 
these stylesheets are still in play, notably:

 _variables.scss
 _bootstrap.scss
 Files in the 'bootstrap' directory

Much of the other files in this directory are slowly being replaced by code 
developed under the 'SITE/PROJECT/dev' directory, initiated by Joel Hagedorn, 
now, as of this writing, being handed off to Andy Mardesich.

In this interim phase, we are including styles from both development efforts:

main.css (legacy) stylesheet compilation process:

EZID (development build only) includes libsass python extension module for processing SassScript.

To build CSS from SASS (.scss) files:
sassc ~/apache/ezid/SITE/PROJECT/src/styles/main.scss ~/apache/ezid/SITE/PROJECT/static/stylesheets/main.css

main2.css stylesheet/javascript compilation process:

Gulp is a build system, reliant on node.js, npm and ruby
https://github.com/JoelCDL/gulp_template

* Running 'gulp' brings up the static "UI Library" development workspace for testing components
    and page layouts
* Running 'gulp build' to generate all production-ready files included in the bash script below


======================================================================
Here's a bash script for building CSS stylesheets within the legacy src environment, or for copying over files generated by gulp build in 'dev'. Eventually, files maintained in 'dev' this should be the primary resource for modifying front-end CSS & JS for EZID.


buildStyles.bash:

if [ ${1} == "src" ]; then
  sassc ~/SITE/PROJECT/src/styles/main.scss ~/SITE/PROJECT/static/stylesheets/main.css
  echo -e "ran sassc on src/styles/main.scss\n"
elif [ ${1} == "dev" ]; then
  cp ~/SITE/PROJECT/dev/css/main2.css ~/SITE/PROJECT/static/stylesheets/
  echo -e "Copied dev/css/main2.css to static/stylesheets"
  cp ~/SITE/PROJECT/ui_library/css/main2.min.css ~/SITE/PROJECT/static/stylesheets/
  echo -e "Copied ui_library/css/main2.min.css to static/stylesheets"
  cp ~/SITE/PROJECT/ui_library/js/main2.min.js ~/SITE/PROJECT/static/javascripts/
  echo -e "Copied ui_library/js/main2.min.js to static/javascripts\n"
else 
  echo "Usage: bash buildStyles.bash [src|dev]."
  echo "Please recheck the variable."
  exit 1
fi

exit $?
