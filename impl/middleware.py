# TODO: We no longer import config here (as it no longer exists). Is the behavior described in this old comment still an issue?
#
# Some things in life are just destined to remain a mystery.  If the
# EZID administrator is logged in and viewing a Django admin page, and
# if the server is restarted and the page refreshed, Django asks the
# user to log in again.  This mildly annoying behavior only happens
# with Django admin pages, no other EZID pages.  But,
# incomprehensibly, it goes away if the 'config' module imported here.
# Why?!
