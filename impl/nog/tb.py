"""Traceback formatter for console output

This traceback formatter is based on the following thoughts:

- In the console, the command line prompt is the focus point for user interaction, and the lines
that immediately precede the prompt are prime real estate, visible without any scrolling, and likely
to be the first place where the eyes focus after having just written the command that caused the
output.

- The further away from the command line prompt the output is, the longer it takes to get to it,
since the text is usually reached by scrolling up from the prompt. So it's also less likely that the
output will be seen at all.

- So we want to print traceback and related troubleshooting output in increasing order of
importance. Least import first and most important last.

- Providing traceback and related output in increasing order of importance minimizes the average
amount of scrolling that will need to be done in order to pick up the information required in order
to address the issue.

- Increasing the amount of output also increases the amount of scrolling required for finding the
information that is important for the particular issue.

- In general, the most valuable traceback is the one that contains the stack frame in which the
initial exception occurred. Stack frames are less valuable the further away they are from the stack
frame in which the exception occurred.

- Chained exceptions (exceptions that occurred while processing the initial exception) have their
own tracebacks. The stack frames in those tracebacks contain the call frames for the calls starting
at the exception handler for the previous exception, and ending at the frame in which the next
exception occurred. That may be valuable, but it's less valuable than the initial exception.

- Dumps of local variables may be valuable, but they come at a cost of having to scroll past them
when they are not being referenced.

- The traceback contains static "post mortem" information, useful for quickly fixing bugs, but at
some point, it becomes counterproductive to add more information to the traceback, as analyzing it
will take longer than reproducing the issue and stepping through it in a debugger.

- Based on the above, this formats the traceback as follows, in order of most to last valuable
information (with most valuable printed last):

- Brief exception information that contains the source location where the initial exception was
raised, and text and type of the raised exception object.

- Brief exception info for the [3] stack frames leading up to the initial exception.

- Brief information about chained exceptions, pulled only from the raising frame in each traceback.

- Repeat of the brief information, but this time including dump of variables available in each
frame.
