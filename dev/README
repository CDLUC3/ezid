========= Front-End development files for WEB UI presentation layer ===========

Development initated by Joel Hagedorn and then passed off to Andy Mardesich
This directory contains the files used for preliminary building and testing the necessary
elements for EZID's UI front end. These are the static, client-side elements, completeley
separate from EZID's django templates.

An entirely separate directory was set up in the inital phase of the UI re-design composed
structly of SASS[1] files, and that are more Bootstrap[2] dependent. A certain portion of
these legacy stylesheets are still in play, notably:

 /src/_variables.scss
 /src/_bootstrap.scss
 Files in the '/src/bootstrap' directory
The primary stylesheet for legacy styles are compiled by main.scss into main.css

The /dev directory contains all the most recent UI development phase, and includes fonts and 
images (which should be copied over to /static when it's ready to be run on Django),
and javascript and SASS. The primary stylesheet for this work area is compiled by main2.scss
into main2.min.css. Primary Javascript file is main2.js, minified into main2.min.js. These
files also need to be copied over to /static when ready to run on Django.

* Eventually, please move everything from the /src directory and merge them here, when time allows. It will make things more manageable to have all UI development components in one place. *

main.css (legacy) stylesheet compilation process:

EZID (development build only) includes libsass python extension module for processing SassScript.

To build CSS from SASS (.scss) files:
sassc ~/apache/ezid/SITE/PROJECT/src/styles/main.scss ~/apache/ezid/SITE/PROJECT/static/stylesheets/main.css

Gulp is a build system, reliant on node.js, npm and ruby
https://github.com/JoelCDL/gulp_template

* Running 'gulp' brings up the static "UI Library" development workspace for testing components
    and page layouts
* Running 'gulp build' to generate all production-ready files included in the bash script below


======================================================================
Here's a bash script for building CSS stylesheets within the legacy src environment, or for copying over files generated by gulp build in 'dev'. Eventually, files maintained in 'dev' this should be the primary resource for modifying front-end CSS & JS for EZID.


buildStyles.bash:

if [ ${1} == "src" ]; then
  sassc ~/SITE/PROJECT/src/styles/main.scss ~/SITE/PROJECT/static/stylesheets/main.css
  echo -e "ran sassc on src/styles/main.scss\n"
elif [ ${1} == "dev" ]; then
  cp ~/SITE/PROJECT/ui_library/css/main2.min.css ~/SITE/PROJECT/static/stylesheets/
  echo -e "Copied ui_library/css/main2.min.css to static/stylesheets"
  cp ~/SITE/PROJECT/ui_library/js/main2.min.js ~/SITE/PROJECT/static/javascripts/
  echo -e "Copied ui_library/js/main2.min.js to static/javascripts\n"
else 
  echo "Usage: bash buildStyles.bash [src|dev]."
  echo "Please recheck the variable."
  exit 1
fi

exit $?
